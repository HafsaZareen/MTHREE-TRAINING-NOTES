print(f"Original person ID: {id(person)}")
print(f"Shallow copy person ID: {id(shallow_person)}")
#shallow copy persion id and original person id are different because in shallow copy, the address is the same object but not person 
print(f"Deep copy person ID: {id(deep_person)}")

# But the address in the shallow copy is the same object so they are same
print(f"Original address ID: {id(person.address)}")
print(f"Shallow copy address ID: {id(shallow_person.address)}")
print(f"Deep copy address ID: {id(deep_person.address)}")

# Now change the original address
person.address.city = "Boston"

# Check all objects
print(f"Original person: {person}")
print(f"Shallow copy person: {shallow_person}")  # The city will be Boston
print(f"Deep copy person: {deep_person}")        # The city will still be New York

# The key difference with a shallow copy is how it handles nested objects (like the Address object within the Person).
# Instead of creating a new Address object, the shallow copy simply copies the reference to the original Address object.
# This is why person.address and shallow_person.address have the same ID.
